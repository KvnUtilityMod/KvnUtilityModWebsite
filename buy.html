        PURCHASE INSTRUCTIONS: <br><br>


        <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1qLGAFUFzeDRds4vNIMLUnw2-xy1LnWCb/view?usp=sharing">Download the KUM quicksetup</a> and run it. <br><br>

        Make a payment of $20 USD to KvnUtilityMod@gmail.com via PayPal. <br><br>
        Send an email to <a href="mailto:KvnUtilityMod@gmail.com">KvnUtilityMod@gmail.com</a> with the code you received from the quicksetup and a transaction reference/your PayPal name. <br><br>
        You will receive a private key via email within 48 hours at most and get access to all the KUM releases, which you can run using your private key. <br><br>
        Unfortunately, KUM currently only works on one Windows or macOS device (the one you run the quicksetup on). <br><br>
        By buying KUM, you agree to the <a href="tos.html">terms of service</a>.
